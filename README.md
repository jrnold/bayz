# bayz

The **bayz** package contains some functions that I use for Bayesian statistics.
These are mostly [stan](http://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan) related.

## Installation

You can install **bayz** from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jrnold/bayz")
```
